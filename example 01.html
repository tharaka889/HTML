	<h1>Sri Lanka</h1>
	<!-- Paragraph & Bold-->
	<p><b>Sri Lanka, island country lying in the Indian Ocean and separated from peninsular India by the Palk Strait.</b> <br>It is located</br>between latitudes 5°55′ and 9°51′ N and <u>longitudes 79°41′ </u>and 81°53′ E and has a maximum length of 268 miles (432 km) and a maximum width of 139 miles (224 km).</p>
	<p><i>Proximity to the Indian subcontinent has facilitated close cultural interaction between Sri Lanka and India from ancient times.</i> At a crossroads of maritime routes traversing the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka has also been exposed to cultural influences from other Asian civilizations. <strong>Ancient Greek geographers called it Taprobane.</strong> Arabs referred to it as Serendib. Later European mapmakers called it Ceylon, a name still used occasionally for trade purposes. It officially became Sri Lanka in 1972.</p>
	<p><del>The distinctive civilization of <center>Sri Lanka</center>, with roots that can be traced back to the 6th century bce,</del> is characterized by two factors: <small>the preservation of Theravada Buddhism </small><big>(the orthodox school of Buddhism having its literary traditions in the Pali language)</big> and the development over two millennia of a sophisticated system of irrigation in the drier parts of the country. <mark>This civilization was further enriched by the influences of Hinduism and Islam.</p></mark>
	<p><ins>In 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule, Sri Lanka became an independent country, and it was admitted to the United Nations seven years later.</ins> <sub>The country is a member of the Commonwealth</sub> and <sup>the South Asian Association for Regional </sup>Cooperation.</p><hr></hr>
